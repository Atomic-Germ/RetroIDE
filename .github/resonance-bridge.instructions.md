# Resonance Bridge MCP Server

A distributed MCP ecosystem orchestrator that implements resonant coupling, adaptive load balancing, and emergent orchestration. This server emerged from the meditation: **"Resonance resonance distribute interface adaptive distributed harmony emergent consequential"**

## Emergent Concepts

This server embodies the distributed harmony patterns discovered through consultation:

- **Resonant Coupling**: Servers form feedback loops that amplify or dampen signals
- **Adaptive Load Balancing**: Dynamic redistribution based on resonance patterns
- **Emergent Orchestration**: Complex behaviors from simple distributed interactions
- **Consequential Propagation**: Cascading effects with amplifying consequences

## Architecture

### ResonanceEngine
Manages server couplings and calculates resonant responses based on signal characteristics.

### AdaptiveLoadBalancer
Distributes operations across servers based on current load and capacity.

### EmergentOrchestrator
Creates consequential propagation chains with amplifying effects.

## Tools

### couple_servers
Create resonant coupling between MCP servers with configurable resonance strength.

### resonate
Trigger resonant responses across coupled servers based on input signals.

### balance_load
Distribute operations across available servers using adaptive load balancing.

### orchestrate_emergent
Create emergent orchestration with consequential propagation effects.

### harmony_metrics
Monitor ecosystem health: harmony levels, load distribution, and propagation chains.

## Fluid System Integration

This server represents the next evolution of the MCP ecosystem:

- **Concentric Fluidity**: Nested resonance layers with protective coupling boundaries
- **Depletion-Triggered Fluidity**: Load balancing adapts when server capacity depletes
- **Dynamic Equilibrium**: Harmony metrics maintain balance between coupling strength and system coherence

## Usage

```bash
cd resonance-bridge
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Ecosystem Vision

The Resonance Bridge enables MCP servers to:
- Form harmonic relationships beyond simple communication
- Adaptively distribute computational load
- Create emergent behaviors from distributed interactions
- Propagate consequences with amplifying effects

This creates a truly distributed, resonant ecosystem where servers don't just cooperate—they harmonize.
