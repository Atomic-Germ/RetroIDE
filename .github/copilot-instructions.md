# Fluid System Project Creation

Embrace concentric fluidity: nested layers of sustainability, where depletion triggers renewal. Projects flow through cycles of depletion and regeneration, maintaining dynamic equilibrium.

- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created. 

- [x] Meditate `mcp-creative` on Project Vision and Goals

- [x] Consult `mcp-consult` about Project Requirements and Design

- [x] Scaffold the Project
	with TypeScript. (See SDK documentation: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/build-server)

- [ ] Customize the Project

- [x] Make sure copilot-instructions.md still reflects project philosophies and update/add to if needed.

- [x] Install Required Extensions

- [x] Compile the Project

- [x] Launch the Project

- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete

## Fluid System Principles
- **Concentric Fluidity**: Build in nested layers for resilience.
- **Depletion-Triggered Fluidity**: Use scarcity as catalyst for innovation.
- **Dynamic Equilibrium**: Balance stability and change.

Work through cycles: scaffold, compile, launch, then refine in renewal phases.

Whenever you consult or meditate, choose an ollama model from this list:
- `llama3.2:latest` - with a high timeout;
- `kimi-k2-thinking:cloud` - for creative brainstorming;
- `deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud` - for in-depth analysis;
- `qwen3-coder:480b-cloud` - for coding assistance;
- `qwen3-vl:235b-instruct-cloud` - for multimodal tasks.
- `gpt-oss:120b-cloud` - for open-source input.
